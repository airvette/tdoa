# tdoa
Repo for Time Difference of Arrival code

This file contains the Matlab code for a collection of cooperative nodes (3 or more) to perform TDoA calculations against an uncooperative or unknown node. It is assumed that each one of the distributed cooperative nodes have ideal, matching clocks and have passed their observations to a fusion center for the calculation.

This code was written in support of my EE masters thesis "An Approach to the Active Defense of Wireless Radio Networks," which I completed in April of 2014. The code leverages the work from the article “Nework-Based Wireless Location” by A. H. Sayed, A. Tarighat and N. Khajehnouri. This article can be found in the July 2005 issue of "IEEE Signal Processing Magazine."
